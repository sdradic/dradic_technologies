It all started with a missing folder and a developer on the edge...

## The Problem

I was working on a React Router project when I encountered a strange issue. The URLs were changing correctly, but the content remained the same. It was like watching a movie where the scene changes but the actors keep saying the same lines.

## The Investigation

After hours of debugging, I discovered that the issue wasn't with React Router itself, but with how the routes were configured. The paths weren't matching up with the file structure, creating a mismatch between what the URL said and what the application showed.

## The Solution

The fix was simple but elusive. We needed to:

1. Update the route configuration
2. Ensure the file paths were correct
3. Make sure the loader was finding the right files

And that's how I made React Router cry... with joy, of course!
